# Flashcards-Program
Python Practice

""" This program is made to test yourself on anything you are studying on and you can duplicate this if you need it for multiple subjects. Please follow the instructions below on how to use. It is a flashcard program that picks random keys out of a dictionary that you can customise yourself as much as you like. It is all set up for you as long as you follow the instructions as given below.
"""    

Once you have loaded up the workspace in VScode or a codespace - you will want to create your own glossary of flashcards which the program will randomly choose out of and you can test yourself on topics you need to learn. 

To make the glossary your own, you will want to go into glossary.txt and you can fully delete what is there and start adding your own or you can build onto the existing one if you are studying computing.

This is laid out as a dictionary so you will need to write your entries into the glossary as follows:

key, value.

key = the main keyword

value = the description of the keyword

It is that simple!!

Once you have filled out your glossary with everything you will want to test yourself on, go ahead and open a terminal window up in your IDE and type in as follows:

python flashcards.py

Once you press enter, the program should start to run in your terminal window. 

You need to either press 's' or 'q' to start using your program.

As long as you follow the instructions in the terminal, you can't go wrong.

Happy learning people and I hope this can atleast help 1 person study out of however many billion people there are in the world. 

Cheers,

W.
